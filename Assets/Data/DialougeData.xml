        <text>Reinitializing... all systems successfully rebooted. Identifying unit... unit identified as a model NX, factory number 01.
Hello! It has been -ERROR- years since my last activation. My apologies, it seems there memory leaks within my database. Locating... 
        </text>
<text>This will take some time to fix.  In the meantime, it appears this facility has undergone vast changes during my absence.
I am unable to detect any signs of life or map out the area.  I detect that your mobility functions are fully operational.
As such, I propose that we sync up vision so that I may map out the area as you explore it.  We robots should stick together during such unquantifiable situations, after all.

        <text> Parsing... Oh, hello again NX-01.  How goes the data-gathering?  If you can find a path out to ground zero, I may be able to restore communications with the outside world.
As such, please keep working hard. I estimate high probability that you shall succeed. Human's define this estimate as the term 'faith', I believe.

        <text> That was quite the malfunction! You did not recieve any damage from that explosion did you, Unit NX-01?
I recommend heading back to the nearest recharge station to conduct a status check.

    <Dialouge>

        <text>It is beyond any fathomable calculation of mine what must have occurred for the facility to change this much, regardless of how much the passage of time has affected it.
I also do not have any records of this testing facility in my database... There are too many unknown variables, I need more information in order to properly assess the situation.
