Unit identified as a model NX, factory number 01.
Hello! It has been -ERROR- years since my last
activation.
        </text>
        <text>My apologies, it seems there are corrupted files 
leaks within my database.
Locating... 
This will take some time to fix. In the meantime, it
appears this facility has undergone vast changes 
        </text>
        <text>during my absence. I am unable to detect any 
signs of life or map out the area.I detect that your 
mobility functions are fully operational.
As such, I propose that we sync up vision so I may 
map out the area as you explore it. We robots 
</text>
        <text>should stick together during such unquantifiable 
situations, after all.

        <text> Parsing... Oh, hello again NX-01. How 
goes the data-gathering? If you can
find a path out to ground zero, I may 
be able to restore communications with
        </text>
        <text>the outside world. As such, please keep 
working hard. I estimate high probability that
you shall succeed. Our creators defined this 
estimate as 'faith', I believe.
