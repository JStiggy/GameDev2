Player can activate SuperVision to see the text 'Remember your beginning as well as a arrow pointing up next to the laser wall.

The lift password is '1234' same as the first password in the game. After entering this password the lift will automatically move up and down, starting once the player
has stepped onto the lift.

Place the Stump to the right of the first metal box to make sure it doesn't go flying if players activate magnetism on bottom box- THIS NEEDS TO BE TESTED.

Proceeding left at the top of the lift will take you to the Core Room.

Player must hover down the right side and land on top of the lower metal box.

Player will then activate magnetism on the upper metal box, causing it to fly to the magnetic generator.

Player then deactivates magnetism to have the box fall on the button, which turns off the laser wall and moves it upward.

Player then rides the lift again and glides off the right side onto the platform containing shield powerup.

Player then glides back to the lift and rides it up and heads left to the Core Room.
