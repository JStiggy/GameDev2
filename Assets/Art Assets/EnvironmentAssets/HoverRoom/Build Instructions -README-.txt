This room is intended to be linked to the top right of the Magnetic Lift Room.

Player enters room from left.

They can interact with the console to move the crane up left down right
Note: The crane head cannot horizontally move past the wall or past the ledge where the hover powerup is on.
      The crane head cannot vertically move above the ceiling or past the floor the player is standing on.

The BoxHolder Ledge should be placed just so that it can fit the head of the crane and 3 boxes.

The player uses the interact key to stop moving the crane, then heads over to the lever and pulls it.
The lever will move to the down position and cause the crane to start magnetizing.

To solve the puzzle, player must lift each box up a small amount and then activate Super Vision to see the invisible numbers.
They must then place all boxes back down so that they can walk over to the keypad and activate it, unlocking the lift.
Lift will automatically move at a leisurely pace up and down once it is unlocked.
The player then heads over to the lift, takes it up, gets the Hover Powerup, and glides leftward back out of the room.
